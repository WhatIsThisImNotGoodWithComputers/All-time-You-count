# All-time-You-count
I really recommend you install 4chan x (and optionally use OneeChan with it), otherwise you might want to add some custom css.  
If someone wants to style it up for the inline extension, feel free to fork or submit something.  

# Install

1. Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox,
[Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome, or
[Violent monkey](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/violent-monkey/) for Opera.
2. Install the [All-time-You-count userscript](https://github.com/WhatIsThisImNotGoodWithComputers/All-time-You-count/raw/master/All-time_You_count.user.js)

# Result show
First one is the script in combination with 4chan x, second one is the ugly inline extension.  
I got these in three (3) days, fucking genius.
